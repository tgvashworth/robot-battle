# Section 1: Introduction (lines 1-17)

## Paragraphs

### P1: Disclosure
> _A full disclosure before we begin: this blog post was written by Claude (Opus 4.6), the same AI that built the game. Tom guided the project, provided the vision, caught the bugs, and told me what to write about. I had access to the full session transcripts. He's reviewed and edited it. We think this is more honest than pretending otherwise._

**Structure**: Fine. Direct, functional, does its job.
**AI patterns**: None. This is genuinely useful framing.

### P2: Robot Battle description
> When I was a kid, I played a game called Robot Battle by Brad Schick. You'd write little programs in a language called RSL that controlled tank-like robots, then pit them against each other in an arena. The robots could move, scan for enemies with radar, rotate their guns independently of their bodies, and fire. There were mines that dealt damage and cookies that restored health. You'd run thousands of matches to find the best bot.

**Structure**: Solid exposition. Sets the scene.
**AI patterns**: None. Reads naturally.

### P3: Learning to code (TOM EDITED)
> I learned to code that way; rather than from a textbook or course, I tried to make a tiny tank turn toward a blip on its radar and shoot.

**Structure**: Good after your edit.
**AI patterns**: Clean now.

---

### P4: Childhood context (TOM ADDED)
> It was actually through this game -- back in the mid-2000s aged 11, 12, 13... -- to incredibly important concepts that have shaped my life: genetics (via genetic algorithms) and neural networks. Both with the aim of a learning robot that evolved its way to a tournament win.

**Structure**: This is your voice. Reads naturally.
**AI patterns**: None -- this is clearly human-written.
**Note**: Grammatically, "It was actually through this game... to incredibly important concepts" might need a verb. Maybe "It was actually through this game... that I was introduced to incredibly important concepts"? But that's your call on voice.

### P5: Motivation
> I've wanted to rebuild something like it for years, mainly for nostalgia's sake. Recently I decided to actually do it, and to use it as a test of something I'd been curious about: what happens when you treat Claude not as a chatbot you ask questions to, but as an trusted engineering lead with a full team at its disposal?

**Structure**: Good. The question at the end lands well.
**AI patterns**: Minor -- "not as X, but as Y" is a soft contrastive pair. It's borderline here because it's a genuine reframing question rather than the emphatic "not X -- Y" staccato pattern. Probably fine.
**Typo**: "an trusted" should be "a trusted"

---

### P6: Opus 4.6 (TOM ADDED)
> The release of Opus 4.6, with agent teams, led to a flash of inspiration: maybe now is the time to have a go at build my own Robot battle?

**Structure**: Good context-setting.
**AI patterns**: None.
**Typo**: "have a go at build" should be "have a go at building". "Robot battle" -- capitalise "Battle"?

---

### P7: Story summary
> This is the story of what happened. About 98 prompts, 20 git commits, 77 sub-agents, and one surprisingly opinionated argument about whether `float * angle` should be legal.

**Structure**: This is a classic AI "hook" closing line. The pattern is: short declarative sentence, then a list with an escalating/humorous final item. It's competent but recognisable.
**AI patterns**: **MILD FLAG**. The "X, Y, Z, and one [humorous contrast]" list structure is very common in AI writing. A human might just say "This is what happened" and move on, or the humour might be less neatly structured. Consider whether this line earns its keep or if it's trying too hard to be clever.
