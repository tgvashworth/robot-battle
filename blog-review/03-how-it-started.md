# Section 3: How It Started (lines 37-45)

## Paragraphs

### P1: First prompt intro
> My first prompt was long. I described the original game in detail -- the arena, the radar mechanics, the separation of body and gun rotation, the cookies and mines, the tournament system -- and then said what I wanted:

**Structure**: Fine. Sets up the blockquote naturally.
**AI patterns**: The parenthetical list between dashes is a bit long but reads OK.

---

### P2: The blockquote
> I would like to rebuild this game in the browser...

**Structure**: This is a real quote. No issues.

---

### P3: Research agents
> Claude's first move was to ask clarifying questions, then spin up research agents -- five of them, running in parallel, each investigating a different aspect: WASM compilation strategies, rendering engines, simulation physics models, robot language design (including the history from RobotWar, CROBOTS, and the original RSL), and sandboxing architecture.

**Structure**: One long sentence. It's carrying a lot of information. The colon-then-list-within-a-sentence is fine for tech writing.
**AI patterns**: None really. Dense but clear.

---

### P4: Synthesis
> Each agent produced a research document. Then Claude synthesised them into a set of architectural recommendations. I reviewed those and started making decisions.

**Structure**: Three short sentences in a row. Factual, sequential.
**AI patterns**: **MILD FLAG**. The three-sentence staccato (short. short. short.) is a rhythm AI defaults to when wrapping up a subsection. It reads slightly like a summary slide. Consider combining: "Each agent produced a research document, which Claude synthesised into architectural recommendations for me to review."
