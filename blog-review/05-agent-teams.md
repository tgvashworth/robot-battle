# Section 5: Building With Agent Teams (lines 112-130)

## Paragraphs

### P1: Opener
> Once the design was done, the actual building happened in phases. This is where the "agent team" approach really showed itself.

**Structure**: Two sentences. Transitional.
**AI patterns**: "This is where X really showed itself" is a mildly stock phrase. Not terrible.

### P2: Kick-off prompt intro
> My prompt to kick off construction:

**Structure**: Fine. Leads into blockquote.

### P3: Agent description
> Claude spun up specialised agents for each module -- compiler, simulation, renderer, UI -- plus a security reviewer and a browser tester. Throughout the project, 77 sub-agents were created for various tasks. Some were long-running module leads. Others were short-lived specialists: "fix this specific codegen bug," "write a bot that uses wall-hugging tactics," "review the docs for factual consistency."

**Structure**: Good detail. The quoted task descriptions are vivid.
**AI patterns**: **MILD FLAG**. "Some were X. Others were Y." is a classic AI parallelism. It's a natural construction in English too, so it's borderline. The three quoted examples at the end are good and break the pattern.

### P4: Pattern description
> The pattern that worked best was giving clear, bounded objectives:

**Structure**: Fine. Leads into blockquotes.

---

### P5: Review pattern
> The agents would work, hit the milestone, and then I'd review the result -- often by loading it in the browser and watching robots try (and fail) to do things.

**Structure**: Fine. The "(and fail)" parenthetical adds natural humour.
**AI patterns**: None. Reads well.
