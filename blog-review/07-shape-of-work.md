# Section 7: The Shape of the Work (lines 186-212)

## Paragraphs

### P1: Opener
> Looking back at the git log tells the story of how the project actually evolved:

**Structure**: Fine. Leads into the code block.

---

### P2: Post-git-log summary
> Research first. Then specification. Then interfaces. Then skeleton. Then real code in milestones. Each milestone was a working state -- you could load the app and do something with it, even if that something was watching a robot drive into a wall and die.

**Structure**: Two parts -- a staccato list, then a normal sentence.
**AI patterns**: **FLAG**. "Research first. Then specification. Then interfaces. Then skeleton. Then real code in milestones." Five one-beat sentences in a row. This is the most extreme version of the staccato pattern in the whole post. It reads like a PowerPoint slide with progressive reveals. The second sentence is fine and actually funny ("watching a robot drive into a wall and die").

**Suggested fix**: Combine the first part into a flowing sentence: "The progression was research, specification, interfaces, skeleton, then real code in milestones." Or: "It went research, then spec, then interfaces, then skeleton, then code." Less emphatic, more conversational.

---

### P3: Incremental approach
> The approach was explicitly incremental. When I felt the renderer work was getting too ambitious relative to what was actually working, I said:

**Structure**: Fine. Transitional into blockquote.
**AI patterns**: None.

---

### P4: Pivot
> And we pivoted.

**Structure**: Standalone one-line paragraph.
**AI patterns**: **MILD FLAG**. One-sentence paragraphs used for dramatic emphasis are an AI habit. This one works OK because it follows a blockquote and signals a real change in direction, but it's slightly theatrical. "So we pivoted" reads more casually than "And we pivoted." (starting with "And" gives it a slightly literary/dramatic weight).
